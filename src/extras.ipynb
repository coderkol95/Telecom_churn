    "# Business problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies usually have a greater focus on customer acquisition than customer. However, it can cost anywhere between five to twenty five times more to attract a new customer than retain an existing one. Increasing customer retention rates by 5% can increase profits by 25%, according to a research done by Bain & Company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn is a metric that measures the no. of customers who stop doing business with a company. Through this metric, most businesses would try to understand the reason behind churn numbers and tackle those factors with reactive action plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you could identify a customer who is likely to churn and take appropriate steps to prevent it from happening? The reasons that lead customers to the cancellation decision can be numerous, ranging from poor service quality to new competitors entering the market. Usually, there is no single reason, but a combination of factors that result to customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the customers have churned, their data is still available. Through machine learning we can sift through this valuable data to discover patterns and understand the combination of different factors which lead to customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this project is to identify behavior among customers who are likely to churn. Subsequent to that we need to train a machine learning model to identify these signals from a customer before they churn. Once deployed, our model will identify customers who might churn and alert us to take necessary steps to prevent their churn."
